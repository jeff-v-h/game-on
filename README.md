# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:

- `cd` into project directory
- `npm start` and the web app should open up in a browser. Check to see that it works.


### To run the production version

- `cd [directory_name]` to be in the root directory of the project
- Follow the instructions in env.README.example to create your .env.production file. (this is not committed to the git repository)
- `npm run build` will create a build directory in the root location
- `npm install -g http-server` to install the http npm package globally
- `cd build`
- `http-server`
- Navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the production version running
